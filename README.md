## Abstract

If you have a gym membership or you're thinking about signing up for one, the most important thing to remember is that you have to use it. The advantages of gym workouts are that they provide several different ways to exercise, so going to the gym every day does not have to become boring and tedious.

## Types of Gym Workouts

Depending on the size of your fitness facility, you may have everything you need under one roof to get the awesome benefits of gym workouts. This includes:

- Cardio equipment. Most gyms are home to a few different pieces of cardio equipment such as stair climbers, rowing machines, spin bikes, recumbent bikes and treadmills. As long as you are healthy and able to participate in most types of exercise, consider alternating between these cardio machines to get your 30-plus minutes of cardio exercise, three to five days a week
- Strength training. Heading to the weight room at least two to three days each week will help keep your muscles strong, your bones healthy and allow you to control your weight. Focus on full-body workouts with exercises for each of the major muscle groups.
- Fitness classes. Access to group fitness classes is one of the advantages of gym workouts. Not only do you get the heart-pumping, muscle-building benefits of the exercises, but you also tap into the motivation and encouragement of working out with other people.
- Other recreational activities. Some larger facilities offer additional recreational activities such as swimming, racquetball, basketball, pickleball or an indoor track. Consider swapping out a few of these activities for your regular cardio workouts.
